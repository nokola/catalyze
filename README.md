# Catalyze
Experimental immediatained (immediate+retained) easy to style mobile-friendly UI on top of miniquad.
Inspired by Dear ImGUI/NanoVG/XAML.

# Goals
* Fun to use
* Easy to style. Create fancy stuff!
* High quality
* Mobile-friendly (fast and redraw-if-needed supported)
* App and game developer friendly

# Benefits compared to immediate or retained UI:
1. Like immediate UI:
* 0-cost abstractions. Render millions of list items with the same speed as 10.
* no event handlers and state handling "viewmodel" - pleasant to use in game loop

2. Like retained UI:
* Easy to reason about UI drawing
* Easy to style

# Example
Catalyze uses `noml` - stands for "not only markup language", inspired by XAML and retained-mode UI descriptions put inside an immediate-mode game loop.
